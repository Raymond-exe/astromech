## Hardware components

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
    - This model is recommended for its small footprint and better wireless capability compared to the Pi Zero W.
- [Geekworm X306 UPS shield for Pi Zero 2 W](https://wiki.geekworm.com/X306)
    - Also required: 18650 battery


## 3D printed parts
Most 3D printed parts are directly from or were modified versions of the parts on [Mr. Baddeley's patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/c/mrbaddeley/home), and are available for purchase as the BB-R2 kit. The dome we used was the "traditional" R2 dome, however any other dome should also work as long as it has the same internal volume as the traditional dome. **All other 3D printed files (body, legs, wheels) are required**.

Since they are available for purchase, only the models which are *not* from Mr. Baddeley's BB-R2 kit, modified or not, are available in the `models/` folder in this repository.
