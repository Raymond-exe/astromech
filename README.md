*Almost* all 3D-printed parts for this project are either modified from or are directly from Mr. Baddeley's BB-R2 mini droid kit, and must be downloaded from his [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/c/mrbaddeley).

Modifications made to Mr. Baddeley's droid parts:
- Modeled a hole in the Astromech dome's eye to fit the camera.
- Modeled 1 front-dome LED hole.
- Modeled 1 rear-dome LED hole.
- Modeled small indents inside the dome to glue magnets for hats.
- Modeled a hole in the main body's back panel to fit a charging port.
- Drilled several speaker holes at the bottom of the body for the speaker to be mounted downward.
